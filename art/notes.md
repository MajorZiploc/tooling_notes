# General

sketch lines - a series of small lines that make up the actual line we want. erase the excess
  comes out better than just 1 line

guide lines are simply guide lines, you can go away from them

# People

heads
  circle and shield method works for some angles
  circle and paper is better

  head is a sphere. when it curves at angles, the face feature guide lines also curve

head profile
  face features will jot out. use the front head as a vertical line guide line down and face features should poke up from that line

dont change eye height! only width

ear basic details
  think 5 and strange alterations of 5
    for a little more detail. think F5. F the 5 a little

hands
  palm is the main meat and it is a circle or cone in most angles with the thumb being its only lump jotting out from it
  fingers a just tubes usually with a little webing between each other if they are spread, else they can share a line

hair
  quickly drawn lines are better than slow
