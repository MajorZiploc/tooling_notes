for sketching:

good to have a pencil(or whatever brush) that can go from low to high values without variation in brush size
  under Brush size click the side icon
    set the min and max value of value to 100 for no variation
    change the pen pressue curve to a exponential curve, like a bowl with the left size on the ground
  12px size brush seems good or close to that
  'Perfect Pencil' works pretty well from CS assets store

its better to work with larger shapes and shrink them if needed
