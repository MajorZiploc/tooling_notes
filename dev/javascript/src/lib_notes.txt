js lib trackdown source of issue workflow: (find the components that break our usecase in a library change)
  Ex: target lib version 10 -- uping from version 7
    Leads to broken test
    in lib project: slowly up the version from 7 to 10 to find which version breaks the test; say v9 breaks the test
      git --no-pager diff v9 v10 > diffv9tov10.git
    find source code files that were affected in the diff
      cat t.git | grep -E '^---.*a/.*\.tsx'
    vim macro to trim down to the name of the files and create a search_phrase
    in client project of lib in the directory of the component that has failing tests:
      search_phrase='\b(Input|PercentInput|SearchableSelect|SimpleButton|Validation)\b'; ignore_patterns='(<|defaultMessage)'; gfind_in_files "$search_phrase" '.*\.tsx' | grep -Ev "$ignore_patterns" | grep -E "$search_phrase"
    this will produce a list of mainly imports of components that were affected by the new version of the library like the below example:
      ./DefaultLabor.tsx:3:import SearchableSelect from "@conservis/style-guide/dist/components/SearchableSelect";
      ./DefaultLabor.tsx:4:import SimpleButton from "@conservis/style-guide/dist/components/SimpleButton";
    From this we now know that only SearchableSelect and SimpleButton affect us
    So we go to v8 of the lib and build the lib locally and copy the v8 components one at a time into our project to see which one fixes the test
      NOTE: you can do this in opposite way aswell. e.g. use v8 lib in client project and copy v9 lib components one at a time to see which one breaks the test
      copy process would look something like this from the client project root:
      ```
      this_dist="./node_modules/@conservis/style-guide/dist/components/SearchableSelect";
      rm -rf "${this_dist:?}";
      mkdir "${this_dist}";
      cp -a /Users/mlakhotia/projects-conservis-nextgen/style-guide/dist/components/SearchableSelect/. "$this_dist";
      ```
    By going through this process - we will find the component that had changes that break our test
