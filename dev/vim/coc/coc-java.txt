Troubleshooting
  Text OK would be in your statusline when jdt.ls is ready and you have statusline integration with coc.nvim. (could be configured by java.jdt.ls.statusIcons)
  Run :CocOpenLog to get unexpected errors thrown by coc.nvim extensions.
  Enable verbose trace for jdt.ls by add "java.trace.server": "verbose" in your settings file, then check output by :CocCommand java.open.output
  Run :CocCommand java.open.serverLog to open log of jdt.ls.
  Run :CocCommand java.open.clientLog to open extension Log File.
  Try :CocCommand java.clean.workspace to clean workspace cache.


  Known Issue:
    tmux resurrect may cause lsp crashing
    To fix delete coc-java cache:
      rm -rf "$HOME/.config/coc/extensions/coc-java-data/";
    Then relauch the vim sessions or :CocRestart

    deleting this cache can also help
      rm -rf "$HOME/.gradle/caches/7.4.1/";
