# Top level ideas

dialog doesnt matter unless your super good at stories and have something compelling

if you have incremental quests, then give incremental rewards.
  paths of exploration should not yield 0 rewards

if you have core mechanics, either make them available right away, or if they require material to unlock, ensure that there are many many ways to get the material without many paths yield 0 rewards
