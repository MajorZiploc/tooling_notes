Math regressions work flow:
  use pandas,seaborn,mathpltlib to plot some points
  look at the graph and look through some basic graphs to see which style fits best
    NOTE: your pointed data might need to be piece wise if different sections of your graph fit different types of graph styles better
  look up the correct name for the graph style that fits your plot
  go to ChatGPT and ask
    can you give me a <graph_name> regression that best fits this set of points: [(1,2), (3,4)]
