xp pen tweaks you need to do:

  NOTE: if the pen tip is going crazy, then you should completely remove the driver and redownload the driver and regive permissions for screen recording and accessiblity

  in xp pen panel for the given application settings:
    pen settings:
      toggle 'Windows Ink' checkbox to see if on or off works
        general rule:
          off for display
          on for graphics tablet

  NOTE: application settings only work when the application is in focus

  right click not working:
    go to krita settings: Settings -> Configure Krita -> Tablet settings
      turn on 'Use mouse events for right click- and middle clicks (workaround for convertible devices, needs restart)' checkbox

    second solution!
      add key mapping for right in canvas:
        You click on Settings then Configure Krita then the preferences window opens.
        There click on Canvas Input Settings, will show you a list of actions and its shortcuts. look for the Show Popup Widget.
        Add shortcut:
          {Type: 'Key Combination': Input: 'Ctrl + Alt + Shit + P', Action: 'Activate'}

        in xp pen panel for your tablet for krita
          in pen settings
            change right click to 'Ctrl + Alt + Shit + P' and name brush_pane

      NOTE: this solution requires that you flick your wrist outside of the canvas into a different menu to then 'right click', it should show the brush_pane

canvas lines blurring but the exported image is fine
  Display -> Canvas Graphics Acceleration and check what you have in "Scaling Mode"
    it should probably be "High Quality Filtering", or "Nearest Neighbor", or turn off Canvas Graphics Acceleration
