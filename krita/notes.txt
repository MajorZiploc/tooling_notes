# change size of anything accuratly (brush size or opacity or percentages)
mac - hold control and click the number
windows - right click the number

# Misc Brush notes:

  / - cycles back and forth between prev and curr brush

  using 100% opacity on the brush setting and turning down the opacity of the layer will remove the noise of drawing over the same area

  change brush size up and down with ] and [

  change color Lighter (l) or darKer (k)
    if on a color palette it cycles the colors in the palette
    if on a color wheel thing, it will go based on that

# smoothing / stabilizing a pen (this is per brush and likely wont save after closing krita)
  1:
    F5 turn on anti-aliasing checkbox in basic brush settings
  2: right side when using brush tool under Tool Options
    should see smoothing options
    set Brush Smoothing to Stabilizier
    set sample count to about 15
    turn off delay checkbox

# transformations (press enter to confirm a transformations)

  # redraw retangle for making various scalings easier
    ex: need to make legs thinner, but they are at an angle
  1. select the area you want to transform
  2. ctrl-t and rotate the area to be straight on rather than at an angle
  3. go to transform tool options contextual menu (upper right)
    click the little square icon (Free) twice
  4. your rectangle will now be angled straight on and you can scale with ease

  # liquify (useful for moving pieces of a more finished piece)
    on right side in tool options, the water droplet is the liquify tool

# Darken a sketch layer or multi layers or a group or multi groups (groups is a little weirder)
  1. copy paste the layer as many times as you need for the darkness you want
  2. merge all layers created by the prev process

  # rotate in 3d space
    hold ctrl and use rotate tool

# Color Adjustment Curves
  Ctrl+M
  - color pop and adjustment
    s cure = color pop

# Mirroring
  # preview
    M to just see the mirror horizontally, doesnt apply the mirror to the layers
      also found in the popup_brush_pane at the bottom left

  # true mirror all layers
  Image -> Mirror Image (horizontally|vertically)

# Rotating Canvas
  4,5,6
  popup_brush_pane -> circle around the brushes has a white dot you can drag

# Fill the background color
  paint bucket tries to be smart
    it accounts for any closed loops in layers above the fill layer and does not color that area
    use shift-backspace to fill in the full layer or selection

# Dockers (Settings -> Dockers)
  Overview -  like the code map thing in vscode

# Locking Alphas - for painting on only pixels that already exist on the layer
  Layer tab on the end of a layer row, the checkerbox locks alphas

  Workflow for this:
    2 layers
      top = sketch layer
      bottom = base color layer
      1. lock the base color layer and paint on it

  checkerbox is limited
  use the inherit alpha tool next to the checkerbox (a looking symbol)
  inherit alpha looks at the pixels in the base (lowest) layer of the group it said layer
    its slightly more complex than this based on what layers in the stack of layers are inherit alpha
      all non inherit alpha layers build up the pixels (aggregate) that the inherit alpha layers can paint on

# Finding Layers
  hold down r and press on the canvas
    looks for the top most layer where there are pixels in that spot
    this applies to visible(or unlocked) layers only

# color picking with using filters
  ctrl: normal color picker will pick the color after filters (filters, opacity, layer effects) is applied to the base color
  ctrl+alt enables the layer icon on the color picker
    this selects the base color

# select all painted area on a layer
  Right click the layer -> Select Opaque (Replace)

# symmetry/mirror drawing
  basic
    1. top right icons, there are horizontal and vertical brush mirroring tools
  advanced (you can move the center line or have multiple lines at which your brush strokes are duplicated)
    multibrush tool (Q) in toolbox
      icon description: 3 lines from point in top right and disperse pointing towards bottom left
    go to Tool Options:
      Scroll down. you will see Type
        symmetry is cool
        mirror is like what you want
          check show origin
          you can rotate the lines

# Dragging various fill bars (such as brush size bar)
  in toolbar:
    holding shift and dragging makes the drag much more accurate
      WORKS IN krita 5.1+
  in canvas:
    <fn>+<shift>+(drag left or right)

# Wrap around mode (check tiling)
shift + w

# WORKFLOW: Fake Line Art step
  once done with all sketch layers
    step away. copy paste and bunch and review it to make sure you arent missing anything
  copy the r (root) of the sketch layers
  select the Background layer and paste (so that it doesnt nest the pasted group)
  rename to v (visual)
  delete lines from various layers that should be hidden
  once done merge all layers into 1 (Ctrl-e on the v group)
  then slam the copy paste on the v layer and merge all the v's together
  done!

# WORKFLOW: simple lighting
  add a 'overlay' paint layer over your color layers and use white

# dodge tool
  good for adding heavy rays of light on anything
  making metal shiny or even skin
  as long as you have a base color and have done shading, this is good for the final touch
  take any brush
    F5 to get to brush settings
    Blend mode (near top of left nav)
      Color Dodge
      (Normal to go back to standard brush)

# soft proofing - for checking your color values while painting. it will turn images to shades fo gray
  <ctrl-y>

# Color

  # Configure Krita -> Color Management -> General
    check Assume sRGB

  # Change color from 1 to other
    Filter -> Adjust -> HSV Adjustment

## G'MIC
### NOTE: requires `brew install --cask xquartz` on mac (still doesnt seem to work even doing this)
Filter -> Start G'MIC-Qt
  Black and White -> Colorize [Interactive]
    Input Type: Lineart
    Output Type: Image + Color (2 Layers)
    NOTE: notes on key comands on on this screen
      notable key commands:
        lay down nodes in colors with left click
        right click either picks up color or removes node
        space updates the preview
        enter finalizes the flats
        r to replace color with a diff color

## Colorize Mask
https://docs.krita.org/en/reference_manual/tools/colorize_mask.html
NOTE: a solid brush will be best for this process
NOTE: steps 5 onward benefit from clicking the Update button in the tool_options
with the paint_layer you want to add colors to selected:
1. left side bar icons: click Colorize Mask Tool. (brush with light coming out of it in all directions)
2. click the paint_layer
3. In tool_options: select Limit to layer bounds
4. select a color for your brush that you dont want to use for colors in the paint_layer
5. Use that color to draw bounds around the area you want to add color to
6. In tool_options: Key Strokes -> select that color and click transparent
  this will make sure that that color is not colorized
7. Lock in the colors:
  once all colors look good in the preview: disable the Edit Key Strokes
    this is done through in the layer_preview window
      go to the colorize_mask layer and click the pen icon (second from the right)
        this will lock in your colors. you can undo it if you dont like it
8. Convert the mask to a paint_layer
  right click the layer in the layer_preview window
    Convert -> Convert to Paint Layer
9. Split newly generated paint_layer to a layer per color
  Top menu: Layer -> Split -> Split Layer...
    defaults should be fine in the window

      Technique: Chisel Soft
      Depth: 15-20%
      Softness: 10-15px
      for easy shadows
        good for a starting point on where you might want to manually paint shadows
    Stroke
      outline

## Layer Type
  add a paint layer above layers you want to enhance and change the type to something other than normal

  ### Types to try:
    - burn - popping of colors
    - mod - mental instability / deep realizations / breaking

## Filter Layers
  Posterize (Artistic -> Posterize)
    makes colors nice and sharp - easy pop
  Gradient Map (Map -> Gradient Map)
    like a color mapping on a scale
  Palettize (Map -> Palettize)
    from your image base colors to a specific palette
    NOTE: also can add Dithering with this
  Pixelize (Artistic -> Pixelize)
    height and width: use even numbers between 2 and 8
    to reduce res of your image
      when happy with starting point, you can resize the image and touch out the resulting pixels
        steps:
        merge the filter layer with the below layers (or flatten the group)
        and resize:
          (Image -> Scale to New Size)
            Filter: Nearest Neighbor
            Pixel Dimensions:
              50% idk
  Edge Detection (Edge Detection -> Edge Detection)
    like a pipe styled light object
      think floating glowing banana at Acadian
  Mean Removal (Enhance -> Mean Removal)
    gives a sharpness to lines. like an oldschool film effect

convert to gray scale
  cmd+shift+u

# exporting pixel art

  Filter: Nearest Neighbor

path for game art:
  In export menu (if options are there)
    Smooth: 0
    sub sampling: best quality
    Large to small file slider - put it to 0 or 1 (closest to large file)

  pixel art needs:
    brush settings:
      Brush Smoothing: None
    selection tools:
      Adjustments:
        Anti-aliasing: False
        Grow: 0px
  nonpixel art needs:
    brush settings:
      Brush Smoothing: Stabilizier
      Adjustments: (optional - pixel settings for this are proly ok too)
        Anti-aliasing: True
        Grow: 1px

# Animation
  Transformation Mask Layers are key for shifting the animation to where you need it
    right click on layer you want to transform:
      Add -> Add Transformat Mask Layer
    NOTE: its nondestrutable to the original non transformed thing
    To make it destructive, you need to flatten the layer that the Transformation Mask Layer is associated with
      right click on layer you want to flatten/apply the transform to (layer with the sub Transformation Mask Layer associated with it):
        Flatten Layer
