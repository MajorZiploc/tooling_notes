# NOTE
preferences are found in different spots per os
windows: Settings -> Configure Krita
mac: Krita -> Preferences

# CONFIG LOCATIONS
# IMPORTANT: BACK UP ORIGINAL RC FILES BEFORE OVERRIDING THEM IN CASE OF MAJOR ISSUES

swaplocation will likely need to be copied in manually from old rc

windows: %LOCALAPPDATA% -> /mnt/c/Users/LakeM/AppData/Local/krita*rc files not the krita/ dir there

linux: ~/.config

mac: ~/Library/Preferences

mac ex:
  cd ~/Library/Preferences;
  afind_files_rename "\./krita.*rc.*" "s,(.*),\\1.bak,g" "" "1";
  cd ~-;
  cp ./configs/* ~/Library/Preferences;

update these configs with the machines configs:
  cd ~/Library/Preferences;
  cp `afind_files "\./krita.*rc.*"` /Users/manyu/projects/tooling_notes/krita/configs;

change these to the proper location

ResourceCacheDbDirectory=C:/Users/LakeM/AppData/Roaming/krita
ResourceDirectory=C:/Users/LakeM/AppData/Roaming/krita
mac:

ResourceCacheDbDirectory=/Users/mlakhotia/Library/Application Support/krita
ResourceDirectory=/Users/mlakhotia/Library/Application Support/krita

OR you may just have to remove these 2 lines. play around with it until krita launches



# NOTE: proly a good idea to nuke the recently open files section by simply deleting the list of files under the recent files section in the kritarc

# NOTE: if you copy the rc files onto the machine. its likely that most or all of the following setup steps are taken care of

if there are some things missing you may need to do more configuration

activate krita brush pack 3
  Settings -> Manage Resource Libraries
    youll find it there

# IMPORTANT WORKFLOW TIP
# Multi window workflow to replace needing gimp or paint.net open aswell
1. go to preferences -> General -> Window -> Multiple Document Mode
  choose: Subwindows
2. File -> Open
    open your reference image or reference_*.kra file

  ## exit fullscreen of a subwindow
  top right you will see 3 small icons (only if your in fullscreen window mode)
    most right one closes the project
    most left minimizes the window into a tab near the bottom of krita
    middle will unfullscreen

# Make a new view of the same window in subwindow mode
  Window tab at top -> New View

# IMPORTANT WORKFLOW TIP
# scale ui settings
1. go to preferences -> General -> Window
  toggle 'Enable HiDPI support (try checked and unchecked)
  unchecked seems good on mba
  checked seems good on sl4
    experiment with enabled fractional scale factor

look at xppen problems for krita related configs in ./problems.txt

Note that some these bread crumbs are typically from a windows perseptive. mac/linux likely put there in a preferences window of some sort
